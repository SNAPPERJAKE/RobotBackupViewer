"""Durable backup-run log: which robots succeeded / failed / got cancelled in
the last backup runs. The per-row check marks in the library are transient UI
state that the post-backup refresh wipes; this file is the memory that
survives - it powers the "last run" summary and the retry-failed button in
Manage backups.

One RUN = one user action (a bulk line backup or a single robot), grouped by
the run_id the frontend stamps on every start_backup spec of that click -
except that backups fired while a run is still going JOIN that run (the API
reuses the in-flight run_id), so a mid-run retry of a few refused robots
lands in the same "last run" report instead of burying it. A joining job
reopens the run, and a re-fire of a robot the run already settled replaces
that robot's row (attempts counts the tries) rather than duplicating it.
Jobs are recorded when they start and finished with their final snapshot, so
a crash mid-run leaves honest "running" rows rather than nothing.

Passwords are NEVER written here - retry re-prompts, exactly like the bulk
flow does.

# BackupViewer — roadmap

Where the project is headed, so parallel work doesn't collide. If you want to
pick something up, say so first (issue, message, whatever works) — claiming a
lane beats discovering two half-built versions of it. Ground rules for *how*
to build any of this live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); what already shipped is
in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Legend: ✅ shipped · 🔨 being built · 📋 decided, not started · ❓ open question

## Recently landed

- ✅ **1.0** — library-first shell, history/time-travel compare, fleet health
  scan, backup integrity (complete-marker), manage-backups tooling.
- ✅ **1.1** — the 3D View tab: DCS cartesian zones drawn to scale, free
  turntable orbit + viewport cube, ortho/perspective, per-zone show/hide with
  pendant-style detail.
- ✅ **LibraryImporter 0.1** — standalone hand-out seeder (robots.json → library
  skeleton), built with a parser seam so it can absorb into the app later.

## 1.x train — small, mostly independent slices

Each of these is deliberately scoped to land on its own. Good places to start.

- 📋 **Report export** — CSV per table, self-contained HTML report, print-to-PDF.
- 📋 **Browser-style tabs** — several backups open at once, drag a tab out to a
  floating window. Architectural note: requires the per-session refactor
  (`_sessions` dict); the compare `side` parameter is trailing-positional —
  see CLAUDE.md before touching endpoint signatures.
- 📋 **More scan checks** — simulated-IO-left-on, general override < 100%,
  alarm-frequency summary, controller clock drift, uninitialized PRs
  referenced by programs.
- 📋 **Golden-robot compare** — pick a reference robot; the scan flags every
  deviation from it across a line.
- 📋 **First-run tips + in-app help** — bundled docs (plant PCs are offline),
  empty-state guidance.
- 📋 **UI scaling audit + XXL preset** — raise the current 24px/160% caps
  without layouts collapsing; probe-gated at the extremes.
- 📋 **Auto-update check** — quiet "newer release exists" toast (GitHub
  releases ping, fully offline-tolerant).
- 📋 **Library-wide content search** — "which robots call PROG_X / use R[57] /
  reference DI[279]" across the whole library, not just the open backup.
- 📋 **Absorb `tools/restyle.py`** — the style-clone kit builder gets UI inside
  the app.
- ❓ **Scheduled backups + retention** — nightly fleet backup reusing the run
  log / retry / complete-marker machinery; needs a keep-last-N + monthly
  retention policy before it's safe to leave running.

## 3D View follow-ups

- ✅ **Kinematics + posed arm** — FANUC's own `.def` kinematics imported once
  from a Roboguide install into a local registry (exe ships zero FANUC
  data), the arm posed from the backup's own `CURPOS.DG` snapshot (or by
  hand), DCS user models drawn at their true frames. Every pose
  self-verifies against the controller's printed TCP; "-IF" flange
  adapters are measured per robot from the backup. Unmatched types
  honestly stay un-posed.
- 🔨 **Robot meshes in the viewport** — the skeleton wants a body: Roboguide
  `.rcf`/`.hsf` mesh crack, or `.rmd`/STL/OBJ import (the `.rmd` format is
  fully reversed), then the capsule fitter for arm bubbles ("visual approx —
  not the DCS model" labeling per the locked ruling).
- 📋 **Program points in 3D** — plot a program's Cartesian positions among
  the zones (compose their UFRAME); joint-rep points can now use the same
  forward kinematics the posed arm runs on.
- 📋 **Rail + mount variants** — the pose validator exposed them: rail
  robots miss by exactly their carriage travel (pure translation, perfect
  orientation) and some mounts by a constant rotation. Both refuse to pose
  today (honest); modeling the rail axis and mount orientation would bring
  them in. Needs the aux-axis direction + mount angle from the backup.
- 📋 **Compare overlay** — ghost the comparison backup's zones into the
  viewport (the "what changed in DCS" killer view).
- ✅ **Lines-mode zones** — `$MODE=3` ↔ Restricted zone(Lines) and `$MODE=0`
  ↔ Working zone (keep-in) ground-truthed against real controllers; polygon
  zones draw with their true vertex count. Only `$MODE=2` remains unmapped
  (never seen on a real controller — still shows `?`).
- ✅ **User models + target refs** — `$DCSS_MODEL` (EOAT element geometry)
  and each zone's `$MODEL_NUM` slots parsed and resolved; data-only in the
  panel until kinematics can place link-attached shapes.
- 📋 **Newer-vocabulary verify reports** — the "Working/Restricted zone"
  pendant generation prints its Lines vertex table in a layout the report
  parser shows raw (correct but unstyled); teach the pos-table parser that
  shape when a backup needs it.

## Cameras — Keyence / Matrox (owned lane, in progress elsewhere)

Attach vision devices to robot entries; open a robot, see its cameras;
one click backs up the robot + all its cameras together.

- 🔨 **Phone view** — QR handoff to a phone browser mirroring a snip-picked
  rectangle of the PC screen (GDI grab + stdlib PNG; hand-rolled stdlib QR;
  camera-direct HMI relay kept as the API variant). Landing on the
  `phone-view` branch. Spike findings, for whoever tries "better" designs
  later: WebView2 windows can be neither transparent nor excluded from
  BitBlt via WS_EX_LAYERED on Win11 — a live hollow-frame viewfinder is
  not buildable on this stack; the snip picker is the design that works.

- 🔨 **Discovery** — agreed direction: probe the DesignAssistant web portal
  (:80/:443) and EtherNet/IP ListIdentity (UDP 44818, Matrox vendor ID) for
  the newer Iris GTX — the old FTP/SMB port gates only find Keyence CV-X and
  the older GTR.
- 🔨 **GTX backup transport** — SSH/SFTP (or a DA HTTP export), not SMB; SMB
  stays as the GTR fallback. Blocked on a live credentials/endpoint spike.
- 📋 **Data model** — cameras link to a robot via sidecar *config* (a parent
  id), never by folder identity; group backup fans out to per-device jobs and
  reuses the complete-marker / run-log / retry machinery per device.
- ❓ **Shared cameras** — can one camera serve two robots? Decides whether the
  link is single-parent or a list.

## DCDL importer

- 📋 Absorb LibraryImporter into the viewer as an import wizard (the parser
  seam in `libraryimporter/core.py` exists for this).
- 📋 Parse a raw DCDL (site-wide device/IP list) directly: generate the robot
  *and camera* lists from it. Re-import is a **suggest-only diff** (new /
  retired / changed-IP) — never destructive.
- ❓ Needs a sample DCDL to pin the file format.

## 2.0 — editing (the headline)

Decided principles (these are settled — build against them):

- 📋 **Never soil the backup.** Backups stay read-only evidence; edits live in
  a sibling workspace (overlay). The review-your-edits screen is the existing
  compare engine pointed at original vs overlay.
- 📋 **Apply paths, not binaries.** Programs export as edited `.LS` (text).
  Register/PR/frame values export as a generated one-shot APPLY program of
  literal assignments — reviewable on the pendant, version-proof. Comments
  (register names, IO) push live via the controller's web comment hook when
  on the network. No synthesizing `.TP`/`.SV`/`.VR` binaries.
- 📋 **USB-export-first.** Deploy = a named folder on a USB stick with a
  manifest + step-by-step pendant checklist. Direct FTP write-back comes
  later as a separately gated, human-in-the-loop tier — many sites prohibit
  it, and it must never be the default.
- 📋 **DCS is editable, same as other config** (decision 2026-07-17, reversing
  an earlier read/diff-only stance). Integrators author DCS themselves, so
  edit-and-preview is a real need — and the controller's own apply gauntlet
  (passcode → on-pendant review of the exact changes → OK → power cycle →
  signature re-verification) is an un-bypassable human safety gate that an
  exported file cannot skip. So DCS rides the same apply-path + honesty rails
  as every other edit: the export is an inert proposal, always shown
  **un-applied and un-signed**, never as verified. Bonus — getting the numbers
  right in the tool first means fewer trips through that gauntlet.
- ❓ **DCS load format** is the real gate: what file the controller accepts
  (ASCII sysvar vs binary `.SV`, via which DCS import path). Resolve by field
  knowledge or a Roboguide spike before building.
- ❓ Open spikes: ASCII-upload option coverage on real fleets, the web comment
  hook's availability per controller generation, macro-table writability
  inventory, edits-workspace schema.

## Parking lot (real, but not next)

Live view (poll a robot over FTP without taking a backup) · multi-vendor
parsing (KUKA/Kawasaki — formats share almost nothing) · plotting a second
robot's zones in one viewport · anything requiring WebGL (SVG stays the
floor because rescue-mode PCs render in software).
